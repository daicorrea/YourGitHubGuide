                    <h2>About GitHub:</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Github is a Version Control Repository. It's a web-based Git and it offers Source Code Management, Wikis, Bug Tracking and Feature Requests. </p>
                        <p>The site also provides a social network vibe that allows the teams to use feeds, followers and graphs to analyse the team work on the project.</p>
                        <p>To use it on your computer you need to download a version. You can choose between the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Desktop</a> version or the simple <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> Git Command Line</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Creating an Account:</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>To create a new external account, you have to go to the <a href="https://github.com">website</a>, fill the form and Signup for Github. </p>
                        <p>When you have a company Github, you need to go to your  <a href="http://github.ibm.com/">company's Github Account</a> and enter your intranet information.</p>

                        <p>To start using Github on your machine, you need to have a SSH key connecting your account with your computer. For this you need to follow some steps:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create an SSH Key on your computer;</li>
                                <li>Connect the SSH key with your account on Github;</li>
                                <li>Test your SSH connection.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>Now that we have added all our project's content to the git tracking, let's commit our changes by running the command "git commit" with the "-m" option, which means we can add the commit message right after</p>

                        <h4>Specifying a remote repository:</h4>
                        <p>Now we already have a local git repository, with all our files added and commited. It's time to specify the remote repository we want to push it to.</p>
                        <p>We do that by running the command bellow and specifying the url of the remote repository we have created.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <p>$ git remote add origin REMOTE_URL</p>

                        <p>You can use each HTTPS or SSH url (you can find those urls at your remote repository page, as we see at the "Creating a New Repository (on Github)" topic's image), feel free to choose</p>
                        <h4>Pushing your modifications to the remote:</h4>
                        <p>Finally, to complete our work we have to push the commited changes to the remote repository.</p>
                        <p>Just run the command "git push" with the option "-u" to add upstream (tracking) reference, and specifying the remote and the branch your want to push to (that, by default are called 'origin' and 'master', respectively).</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <p>$ git push -u origin master</p>

                    <h1>Creating Branches</h1>
                    <h2>What is a Branch?</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A branch is an idependent line of development. The main branch in git is called <strong>Master</strong>. You can create how many branches your team thinks it's necessary for the project.</p>
                        <p>But why create a branch if you can send your code directly to the master?</p>
                        <p>Usually branches are used for new features, improvements or even bug fixes in some cases. It also helps with conflicts when one or more people are editing the same code.</p>
                        <p>The code you use in a branch is completely different from other branches.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>How do I use Branches?</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Let's start with an example when the project already have some commits (C0 = Commit 0; C1 = Commit1, ...)
                        </p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="half-img" src="img/basic-branching-1.png" alt="Master Branch">
                        </div>
                        <p>The fastest way to create a new branch is to use the following command line:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git checkout -b [branch-name]
                        </div>
                        <p>This is equivalent of using two other commands:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git branch -f [branch-name]
                            $ git checkout [branch-name]
                        </div>
                        <p> The first command creates a new branch. The second one "enters" into a new branch. This means that your code will be the one that was last saved into the new branch.</p>
                        <p>Let's create a new branch called "iss53":</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git checkout -b iss53
                        </div>
                        <p>To start the branch will copy the code from the Master. We will have an environment similar to this one:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="half-img" src="img/basic-branching-2.png" alt="New Branch iss53">
                        </div>
                        <p>Now Let's say you change something and make a new commit:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git commit -am 'Added a new footer'
                        </div>
                        <p>This means that our branch iss53 will be one commit ahead (C3 - Commit 3) of our master.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="half-img" src="img/basic-branching-3.png" alt="Commiting">
                        </div>
                        <p>What if you have another issue to change that is more important that the one you are currectly working with on your branch iss53? Even if your work on branch iss53 is incomplete, you can create a new branch from the Master for the new issue and go back to iss53 later to continue your code. 
                        First we have to change to the Master branch:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git checkout master
                        </div>
                        <p>Then we create a new branch called hotfix:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git checkout -b hotfix
                        </div>
                        <p>After that we make the changes we needed and commit our changes:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git commit -am 'fixed the broken feature'

                    <h2>Pull Request</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>If you are working with a team and creating a new feature you can open a <trong>Pull Request</strong> to mean that you finished the code in the branch (a new feature, a bug fix, ...) and it can be tested and if it's okay, it can be joined with the Master's code. This can add to group discussions about changes that can be made to improve the code or just an approval of the code.</p>
                        <p>To open a pull request, go to the branches tab on your project's page and in the line of your branch, you can click on the "New Pull Request" button.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="full-img" src="img/pull-request.png" alt="New Pull Request">
                        </div>
                        <p>A new page with the pull request will be creating and you can access all the pull requests you have on the project in the "Pull Request" tab in your project.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="full-img" src="img/pull-request-2.png" alt="New Pull Request Page">
                        </div>
                        <p>You can still create commits after you create the Pull Request.</p>
                        <p>There are two possible messages of a Pull Request. When there are no conflicts in the code you have in this branch with the maste you will have:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="more-half-img" src="img/pull-request-3.png" alt="No Conflict">
                        </div>
                        <p>If there's a conflict, then you will need to resolve the conflicts in the code before joining the code with the Master's code. If that happens you will find the following message:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="more-half-img" src="img/pull-request-4.png" alt="Has Conflict">
                        </div>
                        
                    </div>
                    <h2>Merging</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>To start merging your code you can use the line:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git merge [name-of-the-branch-you-want-to-merge]
                        </div>
                        <p>When you use a merge and has conflicts, you will see the following format in your code:</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="half-img" src="img/pull-request-5.png" alt="Conflicting Code">
                        </div>
                        <p>The red part is what you have in your current Branch and the yellow code is the one that was in the same place in the code you want to merge. In this case the text was altered a little bit so you can choose which one you want to keep and which one you want to erase. Not forgeting to erase the Git tags "<<<<<< HEAD", "====" and ">>>>".</p>
                        <p>If you have no conflicts in your branch, you can simply click on the "Merge Pull Request" button.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="more-half-img" src="img/pull-request-3.png" alt="Conflicting Code">
                        </div>
                        <p>Another option is using the command line. For this, let's go back to our example from before. We created the hotfix branch and created a new commit. The pull request was oppened and the code was tested. Now we want to merge the code into the master code. Firstly, we need to go out of the hotfix branch and go to the master.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git checkout master
                        </div>
                        <p>Then we want to merge the hotfix branch.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            $ git merge hotfix
                        </div>
                        <p>Now that we merged, our Master branch will point to the C4 commit, having the same code as hotfix.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <img class="half-img" src="img/basic-branching-5.png" alt="Merged Code">
                        </div>
                        <p>After merging, you can erase the branch if you want. You can also go back on working in the iss53 branch but remember that the new code that was in the C4 commit won't be in the branch unless you merge them.</p>

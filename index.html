                    <h2>About GitHub:</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Github is a Version Control Repository. It's a web-based Git and it offers Source Code Management, Wikis, Bug Tracking and Feature Requests. </p>
                        <p>The site also provides a social network vibe that allows the teams to use feeds, followers and graphs to analyse the team work on the project.</p>
                        <p>To use it on your computer you need to download a version. You can choose between the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Desktop</a> version or the simple <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> Git Command Line</a>.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>To start using Github on your machine, you need to have a SSH key connecting your account with your computer. For this you need to follow some steps:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create an SSH Key on your computer;</li>
                                <li>Connect the SSH key with your account on Github;</li>
                                <li>Test your SSH connection.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>Now that we have added all our project's content to the git tracking, let's commit our changes by running the command "git commit" with the "-m" option, which means we can add the commit message right after</p>

                            <p>$ git commit -m "My first commit"</p>

                        <h4>Specifying a remote repository:</h4>
                        <p>Now we already have a local git repository, with all our files added and commited. It's time to specify the remote repository we want to push it to.</p>
                        <p>We do that by running the command bellow and specifying the url of the remote repository we have created.</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <p>$ git remote add origin REMOTE_URL</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>You can use each HTTPS or SSH url (you can find those urls at your remote repository page, as we see at the "Creating a New Repository (on Github)" topic's image), feel free to choose</p>
                        <h4>Pushing your modifications to the remote:</h4>
                        <p>Finally, to complete our work we have to push the commited changes to the remote repository.</p>
                        <p>Just run the command "git push" with the option "-u" to add upstream (tracking) reference, and specifying the remote and the branch your want to push to (that, by default are called 'origin' and 'master', respectively).</p>
                        <div class="myCode">
                            <p>$ git push -u origin master</p>
